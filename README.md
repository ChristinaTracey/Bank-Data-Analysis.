# Bank-Data-Analysis.
EDA and logistic regression is done on a Bank Data Set.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

1.Load and inspect the data: 
2.Check for missing values, outliers and the distribution of the data.
3.Analyze the target variable: Plot a histogram or bar graph to understand the distribution of the target variable (churn).
4.Feature Analysis: Plot histograms or bar graphs for each feature and observe the distribution of each feature. 
5.Plot pair plots to see relationships between different features.
6.Correlation Analysis: Plot a heatmap of the correlation matrix to observe the relationship between the features.
7.Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers, and clean the data if necessary.

Logistic Regression:

1.Split the data into training and test datasets.
2.Train the Logistic Regression model using the training data.
3.Evaluate the model using the test data and calculate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score.
4.Plot a ROC curve to observe the model's performance.
5.Fine-tune the model by modifying the regularization strength, features and threshold value.
6.Make predictions on new data using the trained model.
